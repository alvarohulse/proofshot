# ProofShot Visual Verification

ProofShot is an open-source, agent-agnostic CLI that lets any AI coding agent verify its own work in a real browser — no vendor lock-in required.

After building or modifying UI features, verify with this workflow:

1. Start: `proofshot start --run "your-dev-command" --port PORT --description "what you are verifying"`
   If the server is already running, omit --run.
2. Test: Use `proofshot exec` to navigate, click, fill forms, take screenshots
3. Stop: `proofshot stop` — bundles video, screenshots, and error report

ProofShot keeps all `proofshot exec` commands inside the same isolated `agent-browser` session that was created by `proofshot start`, so recording, screenshots, and browser actions stay aligned.

Use `--url` on `start` when verification must begin on a specific target. In an isolated HOME, ProofShot discovers executable-only Chrome/Chromium installs from system/account locations; use `--browser-executable /absolute/path/to/chrome` to select one explicitly.

Key proofshot exec commands:
- `proofshot exec snapshot -i` — see interactive elements
- `proofshot exec click @e3` — click an element
- `proofshot exec fill @e2 "text"` — fill a form field
- `proofshot exec screenshot step.png` — capture a moment

Artifacts saved to ./proofshot-artifacts/ including video, screenshots, errors, and summary.
Custom `--output` paths do not move active control state, so a separate `proofshot stop` still finds the session. `stop` is idempotent; after `stop --no-close`, run a later plain `stop` to close that exact retained browser without rebundling.
You can customize browser launch behavior in `proofshot.config.json`, including HTTPS error ignoring, a custom browser executable path, and a project-specific `agent-browser` config path.

Use `proofshot doctor` when the local setup looks wrong. It prints the current config path, browser mode, viewport, installed binaries, and any active ProofShot session.
